# Model-Microwave
A model microwave developed for grade 12 TEJ4M culminating task, using NI myDAQ kit and LabVIEW.

The program is a finite state machine with five distinct states - heating, pause, rest, opened door, and warning.

The program interfaces with two buttons, start and stop, and a limit switch that detects whether the microwave's door is opened or closed. The microwave has an LED and brushed DC motor to imitate the heating and plate rotation of a real microwave.
