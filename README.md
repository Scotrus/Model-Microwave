# Model-Microwave
A model microwave developed for grade 12 TEJ4M culminating task, using NI myDAQ kit and LabVIEW.

The program runs a model microwave with necessary functions for a basic microwave, controlled by two buttons, start and stop, and a limit switch that detects whether the microwave's door is opened or closed. The microwave has an LED and motor attached to it to indicate the operation of the microwave.
